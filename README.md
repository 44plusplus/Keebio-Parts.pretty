Various KiCAD footprints for mechanical keyboard parts. Accuracy of the footprints are not guaranteed, but a best effort has been made.

### Choc stab cutout outlines
The stab PCB/plate cutouts for Choc switches are still experimental, so use them at your own risk. The cutouts are based on measurements done on an MSI Vigor GK50 keyboard, with adjustments to handle available Kailh Choc keycaps. The stab offset difference between the GK50 keycaps and Kailh ones is 1mm.
